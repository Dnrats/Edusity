## Project: EduSity

## Overview
EduSity is an educational website developed as a learning exercise to familiarize myself with the React framework. The project was inspired by a tutorial video on YouTube, which provided a comprehensive introduction to React over the course of 3-4 hours.

## Objective
The primary goal of EduSity was to gain hands-on experience with React.js, including understanding JSX and using CSS for styling. This project serves as a simple, one-page educational website that showcases a university and provides information on enrolling in various degree programs.

## Technologies Used
React.js: Utilized for building the user interface.

JSX: Employed to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.

CSS: Used for styling the website.

Node.js: To install and configure dependencies.

## Features

Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

Single Page Layout: All content is contained within a single page, providing a streamlined user experience.

Educational Content: Displays information about the university, degree programs, and the enrollment process.

## Development Process

The development process began by following a tutorial by an Indian creator on YouTube. The tutorial guided me through the basics of React, helping me set up the environment and create the components necessary for the website. The choice to use CSS over Tailwind was made to keep the project simple and focused on learning the core concepts of React.

## Challenges and Learning Outcomes

React Fundamentals: Gained a solid understanding of React's component-based architecture and state management.

JSX Syntax: Learned how to write and integrate JSX within the React application.

Styling: Enhanced skills in CSS to ensure the website is visually appealing and responsive.

## Future Enhancements

Tailwind CSS: Consider using Tailwind CSS in future projects to streamline styling and enhance maintainability.

Additional Features: Expand the website to include more interactive elements and additional pages.
